***ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾A BRIEF GUIDE ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾ðŸŒ¾***
Description:

our project named "FARMART" is an e-commerce website that allows a direct connection b/n the farmer and the consumer. it provides an easy mechanism for farmers to sell their products and consumers to buy any fresh and real products directly. so the web page has a login/sign in page  at first that allows anyone visiting our website to be verifiied and saved to the database. after that we have our home page containing some useful informations about the website and buttons allowing you to navigate through d/t pages on the website. the 'Shop' button displays all the products available for sell along with the price, discount and farmer  information to which that specific product belongs to. with in that same page it filters the products based on their catagory and place of production. the cart page displays items added to cart with their total price calculated and gives customers multiple payment systems.

the 'Newsfeed' and the 'About us' buttons gives the visitors of our web d/t additional information. the 'Work with us' button allows farmer to post their products on the webpage which becomes visible for customers with their respective information. their is a login/sign up page found before a farmer posts its products b/c it neccessary to grab farmers information and stored on 'farmer registration' table on our database. the farmer can changes his profiles and can view orders made by d/t customers on his products. The other page found on our website is the 'Admin panel', this page at first allows the admin to login and provides some privileges. it lets the  admin post d/t items to be sold, list of items with prices that are on sale and can remove and edit them, list of visitors that have logged in, order details made by customers.
It starts from  index.php file , then heading to Shop through registration page.
In the page while the incident you press register button it automatically send an email to verify your account  , with meeting the validation as expected. 
Further more if you have forgotten password it will send a resetting code through verifying your authenticity.
->The file is located on auth folder
****************
Expected errors there might be some fluctuations it might not for connectivity issues, 
so far I perceived this.
****************
Expected feature plan to add multi-user login: had tried to work on it, but had conflict of codes of no clue. 
Will discover the bugs and come up with a good version.
